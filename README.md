## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variables
- CSS Flexbox

### Continued development

For the next project with more complex layout, I want to experiment with mobile first approach.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box-Shadow Generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - This helped me for generating box-shadows without going back and forth between the editor and the browser
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/) - No matter if you are a junior or senior developer, CSS-TRICKS is always a good idea.
